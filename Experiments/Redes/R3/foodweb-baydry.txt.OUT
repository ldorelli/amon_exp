FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\LuisFernando\Desktop\Redes\foodweb-baydry.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 129
Number of edges: 2106
Number of single edges: 2075
Number of mutual edges: 31

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

65755 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
63949978 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
64015733 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 13654471 tries were made, 4103295 were successful.
Randomization took 7.47 seconds.
Enumeration took 46.12 seconds.

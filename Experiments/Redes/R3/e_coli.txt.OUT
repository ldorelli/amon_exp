FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\LuisFernando\Desktop\Redes\e_coli.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 100
Number of edges: 212
Number of single edges: 212
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

674 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
905198 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
905872 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 732911 tries were made, 634509 were successful.
Randomization took 0.353 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.476 seconds.

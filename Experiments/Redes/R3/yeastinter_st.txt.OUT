FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\LuisFernando\Desktop\Redes\yeastinter_st.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 689
Number of edges: 1078
Number of single edges: 1077
Number of mutual edges: 1

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

13150 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
13266226 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
13279376 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 3588951 tries were made, 3227139 were successful.
Randomization took 2.257 seconds.
Enumeration took 2795.01 seconds.

FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\LuisFernando\Desktop\Redes\foodweb-baywet.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 129
Number of edges: 2075
Number of single edges: 2044
Number of mutual edges: 31

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

64273 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
62554760 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
62619033 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 13401092 tries were made, 4069610 were successful.
Randomization took 7.518 seconds.
Enumeration took 44.077 seconds.

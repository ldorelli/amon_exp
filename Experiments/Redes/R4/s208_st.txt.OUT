FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\LuisFernando\Desktop\Redes\s208_st.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 123
Number of edges: 189
Number of single edges: 189
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

1787 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1840921 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1842708 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 608116 tries were made, 567297 were successful.
Randomization took 0.27 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.2 seconds.
